# Top100Pinball

A CLI gem to return the current top 50 pinball games as rated by The Pinball Company, and links to more information about each game.  

Flowchart of original plan for this gem's structure is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TREIMY19FsVDe1_zQbQ6C5GmSK1VBv95/view?usp=sharing

I have not published the gem as of yet, because I plan to add additional functionality at a later date.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'top_100_pinball'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install top_100_pinball

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
